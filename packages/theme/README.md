# @kernelfall/theme

The "Section 2" design tokens as plain values: the day and night prints, typography, spacing,
motion, and colour maths. The app's design system turns them into CSS.

> **Note:** values and pure functions only, no components or styles. See `docs/BRAND.md` for how
> they are used.

## Key Features

- **Two prints:** light-first "Day print" and the "Night print" dark theme, with the same tokens.
  Tests hold every pair in BRAND.md's contrast tables to WCAG AA and to its published ratio.
- **One source of truth:** every colour, size and duration the app uses comes from here;
  `paletteVariables` and `sharedVariables` give them as CSS custom properties.

## Dependencies

None.
